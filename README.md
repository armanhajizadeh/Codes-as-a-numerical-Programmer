# Numeric Questions

Use MATLAB or Python to solve the following questions:

1. Find the values of \( x_i \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) ( \( n = 100 \) ).

   \[
   x_1 + x_2 = 3, \\
   x_{i+1} - x_{i+2} = 1 \text{, for } i = 1, â€¦, n - 2, \\
   x_{n-1} + x_n = 3
   \]

2. Estimate \( \pi \) using the following statistical method:
   - Generate a large number of random points (N) located in the square.
   - Estimate \( \pi \) using the ratio of the number of points inside the circle ( \( M > 0 \) ) to the total number of points (N).
   - Expected estimation accuracy of \( \pi \) is at least 2 digits.

3. Generate a sample of raining rate (cm) data in Florida for three years. Then, find the days where the rain rate exceeds 3 cm for 4 successive days.
   - Ensure that the mentioned condition occurs more than 3 times.

4. Assume that a special fish has the following feeding pattern for 10 hours a day:
